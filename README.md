# Project Title
Creative Hub BY Mohamed Altumi

# Overview
Creative Hub is a platform that facilitates collaboration between creators and brands, addressing the increasing demand for influencers in marketing. The goal is to streamline communication between creators and businesses, eliminating the current reliance on direct outreach through platforms like Instagram.

 # Problem
In the current market, there is a lack of a centralized platform that effectively connects creators and brands. Many creators resort to reaching out to brands on social media platforms like Instagram, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities.

# User Profile
The application primarily targets brands and small to medium-sized creators seeking collaboration opportunities. These users often struggle to find suitable partners for their marketing needs.

# Features
Creator Onboarding:

Creators can log in using their Instagram profile.
If unsuccessful, creators can manually input their feed information, ensuring participation even without an Instagram connection.
Profile Customization:

Creators can set location, minimum price, and choose their category to tailor their profiles.
Brands can log in using their Instagram accounts and customize their feed based on location, budget, and preferences.
